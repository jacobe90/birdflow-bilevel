# birdflow-bilevel
Using bilevel optimization to add an optimal transport-based metric to birdflow. See `dev-notebooks` for initial tests of [ott-jax](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott) and [jaxopt](https://github.com/google/jaxopt), and a **jax/optax implementation of bilevel optimization for a toy example**!
