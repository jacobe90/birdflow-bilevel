# birdflow-bilevel
Using bilevel optimization to add an optimal transport-based metric to birdflow, planned research for Spring 2025. Contains initial tests of [ott-jax](https://github.com/ott-jax/ott) and [jaxopt](https://github.com/google/jaxopt), and a [jax/optax implementation of bilevel optimization for a toy example](https://github.com/jacobe90/birdflow-bilevel/blob/main/dev-notebooks/bilevel-toy-example.ipynb)!
